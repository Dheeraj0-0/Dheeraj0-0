🚀 Chillin' with Code: What I'm Up To
🔭 Crafting Web Experiences: Currently diving deep into a web development project, making sure it's not just functional but also a breeze to deploy and rock-solid secure. Think smooth pipelines and smart security! 🔒

🌱 Kubernetes Adventures: Leveling up my game with Kubernetes (k8s) – getting hands-on with orchestrating containers like a pro. It's all about making things scalable and resilient. 🐳

💡 Security Detective Work: Always on the lookout for clever ways to manage credentials and keep an eye on security events in real-time. Splunk and Azure Monitor are my trusty sidekicks here! 🕵️‍♂️

🎒 My Digital Backpack: Skills & Tools
Cloud & DevOps: Azure, a friendly nod to Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and my CI/CD pals (Jenkins, Azure DevOps).

Programming & Scripting: Fluent in Python and Bash, with a solid grasp of how things work under the hood (OOP, data structures, algorithms).

Web & Application Development: Building full-stack wonders, keeping things organized with Git and GitHub.

Database & Networking: Comfortable with SQL, NoSQL, and understanding the core internet magic like TCP/IP and load balancing.

Monitoring & Security: Keeping an eye on things with Azure Monitor, CloudWatch, and Splunk, always prioritizing cloud security best practices.
